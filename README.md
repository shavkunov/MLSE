## Abstract

A lot of prior works used values of software metrics to build vector representation of code fragments. Itâ€™s an interesting task to see if we can predict those metrics values could be extracted by a neural model (GGNN, TreeLSTM, code2vec, and others).

Folder `embeddings` contains embeddings from pretrained java14_model.
Folder `emb_fine_tune` contains embeddings from the same pretrained model, which also post-trained on our dataset.
